    <p>
      Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC)
      is a privately funded notfor-profit educational initiative started by
      President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and Zia Khan to help
      promote education, research and business opportunities in emerging tech
      fields like
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloud Native Computing</li>
      <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
      <li>Blockchain</li>
      <li>Internet of Things</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>

      Computing
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <b><i>Cloud Native Computing</i></b> program prepares the students to
      program in open source technologies like,
      <b
        ><i
          >Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React
          Native</i
        ></b
      >
      while introducing the students to development of Microservices and
      software development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
    </p>

      Intelligence
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <b><i>artificial intelligence</i></b> program of PIAIC takes the
      student through the foundation of the AI technology, via teaching
      programming in open source languages like
      <b><i>Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask</i></b
      >, and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending
      with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 50px">B</span>lockchain
    </h2>
    <p>
      The main emphasis of <b><i>Blockchain</i></b> program is to understand the
      blockchains like <b><i>Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric)</i></b
      >, and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on
      frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development
      of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an
      in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-aservice (BaaS) and how to develop
      and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.

      Things
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <b><i>Internet of things</i></b> program introduces the students to
      open source development technologies like
      <b
        ><i
          >Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant,
          and Kubernetes</i
        ></b
      >
      while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT
      Cloud, and voice computing for device control.
